# GIF-Blurrer
There are many cases of a neccessity where input videos/GIFs need to blur the images of actual people from within them. This could take a very long time to be manually done, but there is a machine learning tactic to solving this problem. A machine that could take each input frame of a GIF or video, find the coordinates of the faces of each frame, and blur that face could speed up this process. 

Luckily, there is a possible machine to do this, and it uses a model called MTCNN.
